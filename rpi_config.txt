# The following adjustments have to be made to your RPI in order to use it as your smart mirror cpu.

1. HDMI config. In the file /boot/config.txt uncomment the following line:
#hdmi_force_hotplug=1
The main goal of the change is to always output video over the HDMI output. Otherwise, if there is no active display at the boot time, there is no video.

2. Enable smart mirror script autorun at startup. 
crontab -e
Execute the command in the terminal and add to the end the following line:
/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/sm2/smartmirror2/main.py &
The first part is the default location of python3 in Raspberry OS, the second part is the full path to the script.
The ampersand sign (&) is mandatory.

3. Enable SSH to control the device remotely.
Execute "sudo raspi-config" in the terminal, select Interfacing Options, navigate to SSH, choose Yes, select OK, choose Finish.

4. Disable RPI screen sleeping.
Execute raspi-config. In advanced options disable screen blanking.
