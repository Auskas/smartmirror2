# The following adjustments have to be made to your RPI in order to use it as your smart mirror cpu.

1. HDMI config. In the file /boot/config.txt uncomment the following lines:
#hdmi_force_hotplug=1
#hdmi_drive=2
The main goal of the change is to always output video over the HDMI output. Otherwise, if there is no active display at the boot time,
there is no video.
